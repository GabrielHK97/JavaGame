<b>Spaceship Java Game</b>
<p>Old java game created when I was in high school to learn Java. This game is based on Space Invaders. As a teenager at the time, I enjoyed games very much (and still do), so everything that I coded was game related. I was also into pixel art at the time, so all the game assets were made in this style.</p>
